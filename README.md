# Power Grid Inventory - Again!  
PGIA is revamp of the classic PGI. A diablo style, grid based inventory system for Unity.

# What's New  
A remake of PGI Classic, this new inventory system has been redesigned from scratch to take advantage of all the
features Unity brings to the table in 2022+. Such things include: newer C# language features, the use of scriptableobjects 
and both MonoBehaviour and non-MonoBehaviour based data models, and Unity's new GUI system, UIToolkit.

# Heads Up  
Take heed however, this is not going to be a commercial product like before and as such I will not be taking feature requests or providing official
support. It is designed with my own personal projects in mind and is subject to change as needed. But given that I know of a handful of people that
have been dying for PGI to see new light, I have decided to make it public for anyone to use, branch, and expand upon.

This project absolutely requires Odin. I do not have any desire to write custom editors when such a tool exists. If you do not have access to Odin
you can still theoretically use PGIA but it will require you to roll your own property drawers that match Odin's drawer attributes in order to gain
the full functionality. It also requires my own HashedString datatype which is linked below.
